"""Shared helpers for the qa.* rail atoms (atom-cutover Plan 3, #355).

Underscore-prefixed so ``atom_registry._walk_package`` skips it — this is
a helper module, NOT a discoverable atom. Holds the ReviewerResult->dict
serializer and the pure rail-aggregation function (weighted score +
non-advisory veto + threshold), both unit-testable without a DB.

The aggregation mirrors the CORE of multi_model_qa.review()'s decision
(services/multi_model_qa.py:762-861): provider-weighted mean of the
positive scores, a veto from any non-advisory failing review, and
``approved = all_passed and final_score >= threshold``. Per the spec's
"no parity check" clause (the granularity refactor changes behavior, so
validation is quality-canary based), it intentionally omits the
validator-warning penalty and the web-factcheck override, which depend on
rails outside the OSS qa.* set.
