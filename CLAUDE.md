## IMPORTANT: New session startup

If this is a new session, read these in order:

1. `~/.claude/projects/C--Users-mattm/memory/matts_voice.md` — How Matt thinks and communicates
2. `~/.claude/projects/C--Users-mattm/memory/decision_log.md` — Key decisions and WHY
3. The latest `session_*_handoff.md` — What was built and what's pending

## Project Overview

Glad Labs is an AI-operated content business — a solo founder using AI to run an autonomous content pipeline that generates, reviews, publishes, and monetizes blog content.

**Architecture inspired by human brain anatomy:**

- **Brainstem** (`brain/`) — standalone daemon (local), monitors all services, self-heals
- **Cerebrum** (`src/cofounder_agent/`) — FastAPI backend, content pipeline, business logic
- **Cerebellum** — anticipation engine + QA registry (learned patterns, quality calibration)
- **Limbic System** — brain_knowledge graph + revenue engine (memory, motivation, rewards)
- **Thalamus** — process composer + API layer (routes all inputs to the right processor)
- **Hypothalamus** — settings service + cost guard (homeostasis, budget regulation)
- **Spinal Cord** — PostgreSQL (all components communicate through shared DB)

### Key Numbers (as of May 3, 2026)

- 51 live posts on gladlabs.io (217 posts total: 143 drafts, 23 archived; 1,467 pipeline_tasks across all generation runs)
- 400 Python files under `src/cofounder_agent/services/` (15 highlighted in the table below are the load-bearing ones)
- 6 Grafana dashboards (post-merge consolidation), 4 alert rules
- 7,900+ Python unit tests passing (329 test files)

## Architecture

### Brain Daemon (`brain/`)

**Standalone local process.** Independent of FastAPI — only needs Python + asyncpg.

- Monitors site, API (5-minute cycles)
- Self-maintains knowledge graph (brain_knowledge table)
- Processes reasoning queue (brain_queue table)
- Logs all decisions (brain_decisions table)
- Alerts via Telegram when services are down
- Auto-restarts local services when running on Matt's PC

### Backend (`src/cofounder_agent/`)

**Entry point:** `main.py` — FastAPI app with two deployment modes:

- `DEPLOYMENT_MODE=coordinator` — minimal read-only API (intended for future cloud host; currently unused)
- `DEPLOYMENT_MODE=worker` (local PC) — claims tasks, runs content pipeline via Ollama

**Key services (15 load-bearing):**

| Service                                   | Purpose                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |

| `quality_service.py`                      | Quality scoring orchestration                              |
| `internal_link_coherence.py`              | Auto-adds related post links                               |
| `social_poster.py`                        | Generates X/LinkedIn posts via Ollama                      |

**Content pipeline stages:**

1. Research (Ollama) → 2. Draft (Ollama) → 3. QA Score (Ollama) → 3.5. Programmatic validator → 3.7. Cross-model review (Claude Haiku) → 4. SEO metadata → 5. Training data capture → 6. Finalize (awaiting_approval or auto-publish if score >= 80)

**Database tables (key ones):**

- `content_tasks` — pipeline task queue and results
- `posts` — published blog posts
- `app_settings` — all config (replaces env vars)
- `affiliate_links` — partner links (DB-managed)
- `page_views` — own analytics tracking
- `brain_knowledge` — knowledge graph (entity/attribute/value)
- `brain_queue` — reasoning queue for the brain
- `brain_decisions` — decision audit trail
- `pipeline_events` — event bus (PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY)
- `cost_logs` — LLM API cost tracking

### Frontend (`web/public-site/`)

Next.js 15 app router. ISR with 5-minute revalidation. Features:

- Blog posts with internal links, affiliate links, related reading
- Giscus comments (GitHub Discussions)
- Google AdSense (ca-pub-4578747062758519, pending approval)
- Google Analytics (G-NJMBCYNDWN)
- ViewTracker beacon (own analytics → page_views table)
- Sitemap.xml (dynamic, 72+ URLs)
- Google Search Console verified

### MCP Server (`mcp-server/`)

Custom MCP server for Claude desktop app. 25 tools across content / approval / settings / memory / observability surfaces. The sibling `mcp-server-gladlabs/` adds 3 operator-only tools layered on top (private to the Glad Labs operator overlay; not in the public mirror).

**Authentication:** OAuth 2.1 Client Credentials Grant (Phase 2 shipped 2026-05-02). Static Bearer tokens still accepted as a dual-auth fallback during the soak window — Phase 3 (#249) removes them once every consumer is verified on OAuth.

### Configuration (#198 — no hardcoded values in code)

**Bootstrap is the only config on disk.** Written by `poindexter setup`
to `~/.poindexter/bootstrap.toml`. Contains ONE value: `database_url`
(plus optional operator-notification channels for when the system
can't start cleanly). **No `.env` required.**

```toml
# ~/.poindexter/bootstrap.toml
database_url = "postgresql://..."
telegram_bot_token = ""
telegram_chat_id = ""
discord_ops_webhook_url = ""
```

Resolution priority in `brain.bootstrap.resolve_database_url()`:
explicit CLI arg → bootstrap.toml → DATABASE_URL → LOCAL_DATABASE_URL
→ POINDEXTER_MEMORY_DSN. If nothing resolves, `require_database_url()`
fires `notify_operator()` (Telegram → Discord → alerts.log → stderr)
then `sys.exit(2)`.

**Everything else lives in `app_settings` (450+ active keys).** Code accesses
settings through a `SiteConfig` instance that is dependency-injected
(Phase H, GH#95). `main.py` constructs the canonical instance, loads it
from the DB at startup, and attaches it to `app.state.site_config`.

Get a reference to the instance through the appropriate DI seam:

- **Route handlers:** `site_config: SiteConfig = Depends(get_site_config_dependency)`
- **Services:** accept `site_config` in `__init__` (ctor kwarg) or the
  method signature, store on `self._site_config`
- **Pipeline stages:** `context.get("site_config")` — seeded by
  `content_router_service.process_content_generation_task`
- **Image providers / taps / topic sources:** `config.get("_site_config")` —
  seeded by the dispatcher/runner

Then call methods on the instance:

- `site_config.get(key, default)` — sync, reads from in-memory cache
  populated at startup
- `site_config.get_secret(key, default)` — **async**, hits DB each call
  (secrets are filtered out of the cache, so `is_secret=true` keys
  MUST be fetched via this method)

Do NOT write `from services.site_config import site_config` — that
module-level singleton was removed in Phase H step 5. Tests should
construct their own instance with `SiteConfig(initial_config={...})`
or use the `test_site_config` fixture in `tests/unit/conftest.py`.

For SaaS / A/B-testing readiness, every tunable should be a
DB-backed setting. Background algorithm windows (anomaly detection,
dedup lookback, failure rate windows) are NOT exceptions — they're
also settings with sensible defaults.

**Storage is provider-agnostic.** `storage_*` keys in app*settings
target any S3-compatible provider (R2, S3, B2, MinIO). The old
`cloudflare_r2*\*` keys still work as a fallback but are deprecated.

### Deployment

Source of truth: `docs/operations/ci-deploy-chain.md`. Two-remote model (post-2026-04-30 gitea decommission):

- **`origin` = `Glad-Labs/glad-labs-stack`** (private GitHub) — full tree (public + Glad Labs operator/premium overlay). Vercel watches this and deploys `www.gladlabs.io`. Push your day-to-day work here.
- **`github` = `Glad-Labs/poindexter`** (public GitHub) — open-source product subset. Refreshed from origin via `scripts/sync-to-github.sh`, which strips private files (web/public-site, web/storefront, mcp-server-gladlabs, marketing, premium dashboards, writing_samples, gladlabs-config, .shared-context, CLAUDE.md, etc.).

**Cross-repo sync is automatic.** GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/sync-to-public-poindexter.yml` runs on every push to `origin/main` and mirrors the filtered subset to Glad-Labs/poindexter in ~30s, using a write-enabled deploy key (private key stored as `POINDEXTER_DEPLOY_KEY` secret on glad-labs-stack). Just `git push origin main` and the public mirror updates itself.

**Mirror force-push posture (intentional):** Glad-Labs/poindexter has `allow_force_pushes: true` in its classic branch protection AND no `non_fast_forward` rule in its ruleset. The mirror is rebuilt from scratch on every sync (filter → force-push), so force-push protection on a derived branch would just keep the mirror permanently stale. The classic protection still requires the public-side CI checks (test-backend, migrations-smoke, Mintlify Deployment, link-rot) to pass on the resulting commit. **Do not re-enable force-push protection on the public mirror — it will silently break the sync workflow.**

**Bypass mechanism:** include `[skip-public-sync]` in the commit message to keep a particular commit private (in-progress branches, sensitive WIP).

**Local fallback:** `git pushe` (alias for `bash scripts/push-everywhere.sh`) does the same thing locally — useful when CI is broken or you want immediate feedback iterating on the sync filter itself. Set up by `bash scripts/install-git-hooks.sh` after a fresh clone.

Backend + brain run locally on Matt's PC; Vercel only handles the static/SSR frontend slice from glad-labs-stack.

## Key Principles

- **Async-everywhere:** FastAPI uses async/await throughout; never block the event loop
- **Brain architecture:** System modeled after human brain anatomy — each region independent
- **PostgreSQL as spinal cord:** All components communicate through shared DB tables, not imports
- **Anti-hallucination:** Three layers — prompts, LLM QA, programmatic validator. See [`docs/architecture/anti-hallucination.md`](docs/architecture/anti-hallucination.md) for the full layer-by-layer breakdown (rule groups, reviewers, prompts, aggregation logic).
- **Config in DB, not code:** `app_settings` table replaces environment variables AND hardcoded constants. If you write a literal in production code, ask "could a customer tune this?" — if yes, it goes in app_settings.
- **Fail loud + notify:** Missing required config triggers `notify_operator()` (Telegram → Discord → alerts.log) then `sys.exit(2)`. No silent fallbacks.
- **Self-healing:** Brain daemon monitors and restarts services autonomously
- **Model router first:** Use cost tiers (`free`/`budget`/`standard`/`premium`) not hardcoded model names
- **Revenue-aware:** Content decisions informed by what generates traffic and money
- **Matt's preferences:** Autonomous work (don't ask "what's next"), minimize env vars, manage from phone via Telegram/Grafana, no client/agency work — fully automated passive income. "Think 5 years down the road if this is a SaaS product" — EVERY tunable goes in app_settings, not code.

## Monitoring

- **Grafana Cloud:** gladlabs.grafana.net — 6 dashboards (merged set)
- **Dashboards:** Ops (home), Performance, Hardware, Pipeline, Cost, Quality, plus built-in
- **Alerts → Telegram + Discord:** stuck tasks, failure rate, worker offline, GPU temp, VRAM usage
- **Playlist:** "Glad Labs Command Center" cycles all dashboards every 30s

## Cron Jobs (re-create on new sessions)

```
Self-healing agent: hourly at :13 — health check + auto-fix
Code quality agent: every 4h at :37 — security/dead code/error handling scans
```
