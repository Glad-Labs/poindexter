"""Shared bootstrap.toml + DSN resolver for ``poindexter <cmd>`` CLIs.

Every ``poindexter`` subcommand needs to read the same DB DSN. Originally
each module had its own copy-pasted ``_dsn()`` that read env vars only —
``brain.bootstrap`` is the canonical resolver but it's not on sys.path
for installed CLI invocations (poindexter-backend ships only
``cofounder_agent``), so importing it silently fails and we fall through
to env vars.

That bug class burned ``poindexter auth migrate-cli`` on Matt's host: a
stale ``LOCAL_DATABASE_URL`` pointing at an unreachable cloud DSN took
priority over the working ``~/.poindexter/bootstrap.toml::database_url``,
and asyncpg timed out at connect with WinError 121.

This module vendors a minimal bootstrap.toml reader so every CLI gets
the same resolution order — matching CLAUDE.md §Configuration:

  ``~/.poindexter/bootstrap.toml::<key>`` → env vars (in order).
