"""Shared narration-TTS helper for the Stage-2 media render atoms (#689).

Underscore-prefixed so the atom-registry filesystem scan SKIPS it
(``services/atom_registry.py``: files starting with ``_`` are not discovered as
atoms). This is plumbing, not an atom — mirrors ``_media_render.py``.

Synthesizes a narration script into an MP3 via the existing ``PodcastService``
TTS, after appending the per-medium CTA outro. Used by ``media.render_narration``
(long + short video narration) AND ``podcast.render`` (podcast narration), so the
CTA-append + synth + fail-soft contract lives in ONE place.
