# Podcast Pipeline — Stage 3 (`podcast_pipeline`)

**Status:** Podcast lane (§3 DISPATCH → STAGE 3 → DISTRIBUTE → FEED) **implemented
2026-06-12**, dormant behind `podcast_pipeline_trigger_enabled` (default off). The
video-side consolidation (drop `video_long`, reconciliation re-dispatch, delete the
backfill jobs) is **deferred to a dedicated change — see §11** (it touches the live,
flag-on YouTube lane and carries a double-upload risk that warrants an attended cutover).
**Epic:** [Glad-Labs/poindexter#689](https://github.com/Glad-Labs/poindexter/issues/689) (media_pipeline redesign).
**Deviation from #689:** the approved `video-pipeline-redesign.md` keeps podcast as a
parallel branch inside the single `media_pipeline` graph. This design **splits podcast
into its own isolated Stage-3 graph_def** (`podcast_pipeline`) with its own dispatcher
and distribute lane, for hard process-level isolation from the video render lane (a
video-render crash can never touch podcast production). Operator decision, 2026-06-11.

## 1. Problem (the regression this fixes)

Podcasts stopped appearing on Spotify ~2026-05-28. Root cause: the podcast RSS feed
gates episodes on `media_approvals(medium='podcast', status='approved')`, but the
current producer (`media_reconciliation` watchdog) writes `media_assets` rows **without
ever seeding `media_approvals`**. The legacy `backfill_podcasts` job that _did_ seed
approvals is dead-on-arrival — the watchdog drops the MP3 on local disk first, so
`PodcastService.episode_exists()` is true and backfill skips before calling
`record_pending`. Net: every podcast generated since 2026-05-28 sits in R2, invisible to
the feed. Video (YouTube) is stalled by the identical seam — `media_approvals` for
`video`/`video_short` is equally frozen at 2026-05-28.

`media_assets` is the canonical file registry (#161). The fix makes podcast production a
first-class atom pipeline that writes `media_assets` **and** seeds `media_approvals`,
and repoints the feed at `media_assets` so it stops depending on a fragile local-disk
scan.

## 2. Goal & principles

- **Composable graph_def, not cron.** Podcast render/QA/persist run as atoms in a
  `podcast_pipeline` graph_def under `TemplateRunner`, with `atom_runs` observability —
  mirroring `canonical_blog` (#355) and `media_pipeline` (#689).
- **Hard isolation from video.** Own graph, own dispatcher, own distribute job, own
  dispatch marker. Podcast ships to Spotify while videos are rejected/regenerated, and
  a video-graph failure cannot halt podcast production.
- **`media_assets` is the single source of truth.** Both production and the feed read
  it. No local-disk episode scan.
- **Human approval, per-asset.** Podcast seeds its own `media_approvals` row via
  `record_pending` (auto-approve tiers apply). Reject → regenerate in isolation.
- **DB-first config.** Per-medium CTA, voice pool, all tunables in `app_settings`.
- **Flip live.** No cutover flag; `media_reconciliation` stays as the re-dispatch net.

## 3. Stage-3 flow

```
STAGE 1 — canonical_blog (existing)
  produces & persists podcast_script (+ intro-sting path, #690) in
  pipeline_versions.task_metadata
          │  Gate 1 (blog approve → publish) — existing
          ▼
DISPATCH — dispatch_podcast_pipeline (NEW job, every 5 min)
  eligible = task status in (approved, published)
           AND persisted podcast_script
           AND podcast_dispatched_at IS NULL
  claim (stamp podcast_dispatched_at) → run podcast_pipeline
          ▼
STAGE 3 — podcast_pipeline (NEW graph_def)
  podcast.load_script → podcast.render → qa.audio → podcast.persist → END
          ▼
DISTRIBUTE — podcast_distribute (NEW job, every 10 min)
  1. link: resolve post via posts.metadata->>'pipeline_task_id', back-stamp media_assets.post_id
  2. seed: record_pending(medium='podcast') for any podcast asset lacking an approval  ← heals backlog
  3. deliver (on approved): ensure R2 upload at podcast/v2/{post_id}.mp3 → rebuild podcast/feed.xml on R2 → record_dispatched
          ▼
FEED — GET /podcast-feed.xml (Next.js) → R2 podcast/feed.xml
  worker /api/podcast/feed.xml now reads media_assets ⋈ media_approvals(approved)

SAFETY NET — media_reconciliation
  drift detected (published podcast-wanting post, no asset) → re-dispatch podcast_pipeline
  (clear podcast_dispatched_at, capped attempts); keep drift alert. No inline regen.
```

> **Interim self-healing seed (shipped 2026-06-14, ahead of §11).** Until the

> seeds the per-medium `media_approvals` gate inline (via `_seed_approval_gate`
> → `record_pending`, idempotent + non-fatal) for **every** stamped podcast /
> video asset. This closes the freeze vector directly: the watchdog can no
> longer stamp a `media_assets` row without also entering the asset into the
> approval queue — regardless of whether `podcast_distribute` is dormant. It's
> the durable fix for the 2026-05-27→06-13 Spotify/Apple freeze
> (`feedback_approval_gate_all_media`).

### Deletions

- ⏸ `services/jobs/backfill_podcasts.py`, `services/jobs/backfill_videos.py` (subsumed — closes #668). Deferred to §11: `media_distribute` imports `backfill_videos._build_youtube_description` / `_parse_seo_keywords`, so the helpers must be extracted first.
- ⏸ `video_long` strings (`media_asset_recorder.py`, etc. — #569 partial, closes #573). Deferred to §11.

## 5. Vocabulary

Target end-state: `media_assets.type ∈ {podcast, video, video_short}`;
`media_approvals.medium` identical. No `video_long`.

**Correction (2026-06-12, from prod data):** `video_long` is NOT 2 stray rows — it
is **10 linked rows, all with a sibling `video` row for the same post**, written by
a _second active producer_. Two producers + two distributors are keyed off the two
names today:

| Producer                   | writes `media_assets.type` | path key        | distributor                            |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `media.persist` (pipeline) | `video_long`               | `{task_id}.mp4` | `media_distribute` (CASE → video_long) |
| `media_reconciliation`     | `video`                    | `{post_id}.mp4` | `backfill_videos` (disk scan)          |

`media_distribute`'s join `mas.type = CASE ma.medium WHEN 'video' THEN 'video_long'`
is a **routing key**: it makes that job deliver _only_ the pipeline render and skip
reconciliation's `video` rows. Collapsing both names to `video` (the rename) makes
the join match **both** rows per post → with `media_pipeline_trigger_enabled=true`
(live in prod) the next cycle can **double-upload the same video to YouTube**. So the
rename is inseparable from §11's reconciliation + backfill-deletion work, and the
existing 10 dup rows must be de-duplicated (not blindly relabeled). This is why the
video side is deferred — see §11.

## 6. CTAs (per-medium, DB-configurable)

`app_settings`: `media.cta.podcast` (default: "If you enjoyed this, rate and review the
show on Spotify or Apple Podcasts — it genuinely helps."), `media.cta.video` /
`media.cta.video_short` (default: "Like and subscribe for more."). Render atoms append
the medium's outro before TTS / as the end beat. ML-tunable later.

## 7. Reject → recreate

Clearing a medium's dispatch marker re-runs that medium's graph **fresh** (new render).
Reject → dump = status stays `rejected`, no re-dispatch (optional R2/asset purge).

## 8. Testing (docs + tests default)

- Unit: each new atom (`podcast.render` TTS-mocked → path+duration; `podcast.persist`
  records the row; `podcast.load_script` reads task_metadata), `dispatch_podcast_pipeline`
  claim/skip, `podcast_distribute` link/seed/deliver, feed route media_assets query +
  pagination, CTA append, reconciliation re-dispatch + attempt cap.
- Integration: `podcast_pipeline` end-to-end emits a podcast asset → distribute seeds →
  tier-1 auto-approve → feed lists it (sourced from media_assets).
- Migration smoke + lint (imports stay light).

## 9. Issues

- **Closes with the podcast PR:** #746 (podcast `/episodes` pagination part).
- **Deferred to §11 (video-side cutover):** #573 (`video_long` rows), #668 (delete
  backfill jobs), #569 (`video_long` strings).
- **References (deferred):** #685/#686/#687/#688/#669/#1193/#531/#449/#1343.
- New tracking issue under #689 at PR time (code → `glad-labs-stack`).

## 10. One-time backlog heal

**Prod data (2026-06-12):** 78 podcast `media_assets`, all post-linked, **16 with no
`media_approvals` row** — the stuck episodes. `podcast_distribute` Pass 2 calls
`record_pending('podcast')` for each on the first cycle after deploy, so the backlog
heals automatically (no separate data migration). The 59 already-approved episodes
surface immediately via the media_assets-sourced feed (§4 `routes/podcast_routes.py`),
which no longer requires the MP3 to be present on the worker's local disk — the actual
mechanism of the 2026-05-28 Spotify freeze.

## 11. Deferred — video-side consolidation (separate, attended change)

The video half of #689 is **intentionally not** in the podcast-lane change. Per §5, it
is a coordinated, all-or-nothing cutover on a **live, flag-on** lane with an
outward-facing double-upload risk, so it warrants its own focused (ideally attended)
PR rather than an unattended autonomous pass. It must land as one unit:

1. **Writer** — `media.persist` `_TARGETS`: write `video` (not `video_long`).
2. **Distributor** — `media_distribute`: `_TYPE_TO_MEDIUM` → identity
   `{video, video_short}`; join `mas.type = ma.medium`; and **de-dup** so a post
   never has two `video` assets feeding the approved-undispatched query (else
   double-send). Decide canonical between the reconciliation (`{post_id}.mp4`) and
   pipeline (`{task_id}.mp4`) renders.
3. **Reconciliation** — stop writing `video` assets directly; re-dispatch the video
   medium (clear `media_pipeline_dispatched_at`, capped attempts) so `media.persist`
   is the sole video producer. Keep the drift alert.
4. **Backfill** — delete `backfill_videos` (and `backfill_podcasts`), first extracting
   `_build_youtube_description` / `_parse_seo_keywords` (imported live by
   `media_distribute`) to a shared home.
5. **Data migration** — relabel/de-dup the 10 existing `video_long` rows → one `video`
   row per post.
6. **Video CTA** — append `media.cta.video` as an end beat; the video shares the base
   narration, so a _spoken_ CTA needs its own render path (don't reuse the
   podcast-CTA'd audio).
7. **`recorder` + `cli/posts.py` + reconciliation read-side** — drop the `video_long`
   strings (closes #573).
