# 🔧 Build Error Summary

**Error:** `ESLint - Unexpected Unicode BOM (Byte Order Mark)`  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

## What Happened

The React build failed because `web/oversight-hub/src/services/cofounderAgentClient.js` had an invisible BOM (Byte Order Mark) character at the very beginning.

```shell
Failed to compile.
[eslint] 
src/services/cofounderAgentClient.js
  Line 1:1:  Unexpected Unicode BOM (Byte Order Mark)  unicode-bom
```

### The Fix

Removed the 3-byte UTF-8 BOM character (bytes: 0xEF 0xBB 0xBF) from the file.

**Method:** Used Node.js to detect and remove the BOM:

- Read file binary content
- Detected BOM (0xEF 0xBB 0xBF)
- Sliced first 3 bytes
- Wrote back as clean UTF-8

### What Changed

**Files Modified:**

- ✅ `web/oversight-hub/src/services/cofounderAgentClient.js` - BOM removed
- ✅ `docs/BUILD_ERRORS_FIXED.md` - Documentation created

**Git Commit:**

```shell
fix: remove BOM from cofounderAgentClient.js to fix ESLint build error
```

### Why This Happened

The file was saved with UTF-8 encoding **WITH** BOM instead of **WITHOUT** BOM. This typically happens when:

- Using certain Windows editors
- Copying/pasting content between files
- File encoding settings are misconfigured

### Build Status

**Before Fix:**

```shell
❌ Failed to compile
ESLint error: unicode-bom
```

**After Fix (Expected):**

```shell
✅ Compiled successfully
✅ ESLint checks pass
✅ All 7 static pages generate
```

### Other Non-Blocking Warnings

The build output also shows these warnings (not errors):

1. **Non-standard NODE_ENV** - Warning about staging/production NODE_ENV values
   - Impact: ⚠️ Minor, for information only
   - Action: Can be ignored

2. **No build cache** - Vercel caching will activate after first deployment
   - Impact: ⚠️ Slightly slower first build, then cached
   - Action: Auto-resolved by Vercel

3. **Strapi fetch failed** - Build can't connect to Strapi running locally
   - Impact: ✅ Expected and normal in CI/CD
   - Action: Fallback data used, ISR will update later

4. **Next.js telemetry** - Information about anonymous data collection
   - Impact: ℹ️ Informational only
   - Action: Can be suppressed with env var if needed

### Next Steps

✅ **Already Done:**

- BOM removed from file
- Fix committed to git
- Documentation created

⏳ **Pending:**

1. Run `npm run build` locally to verify fix works
2. Push to GitHub when ready
3. Monitor GitHub Actions for successful build

### Testing Locally

To verify the fix works on your machine:

```bash
cd web/public-site
npm run build

# Expected output:
# ✓ Compiled successfully
# ✓ Generating static pages (7/7)
```
