## ��� Outcomes & Benefits

### Immediate Outcomes
- ✅ Documentation is now **lean and maintainable**
- ✅ **High-level focus** prevents staleness
- ✅ **Architecture stable** while code evolves
- ✅ **100% organized** with zero violations
- ✅ **All links working** and verified

### Long-term Benefits
- ��� **Reduced maintenance burden:** No more outdated guides to maintain
- ��� **Better scalability:** Core docs don't grow with features
- ��� **Clear governance:** Defined what belongs in docs vs. code
- ��� **Historical audit trail:** Complete archive preserved
- ��� **Quarterly compliance:** Regular reviews prevent drift

---

## ��� Maintenance Going Forward

### Quarterly Review (Recommended: April 2026)

1. Scan root directory for new .md files
2. Scan docs/ for files not in core/reference/decisions/components/troubleshooting
3. Move any violations to archive-old/ with current date
4. Update 00-README.md statistics

### File Placement Guide

| File Type | Keep? | Where |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Architecture decisions | ✅ | decisions/ |
| API specifications | ✅ | reference/ |
| Component overviews | ✅ | components/ |
| Deployment procedures | ✅ | 03-DEPLOYMENT_AND_INFRASTRUCTURE.md |
| Code standards | ✅ | reference/GLAD-LABS-STANDARDS.md |
| Common troubleshooting | ✅ | troubleshooting/ |
| Feature how-tos | ❌ | Code comments (not docs) |
| Status updates | ❌ | Archive or delete |
| Session notes | ❌ | Archive with dating |
| Audit reports | ❌ | Archive with dating |
| Analysis documents | ❌ | Archive with dating |
