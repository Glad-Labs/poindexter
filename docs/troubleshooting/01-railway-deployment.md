# 🚀 Railway Deployment Fix - October 26, 2025

**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Issue:** Build failure due to missing LICENSE.md in Docker build context  
**Solution:** Updated `.dockerignore` to preserve LICENSE.md

---

## 🔴 The Problem

Railway's Railpack builder was failing with:

```bash
Build Failed: bc.Build: failed to solve: lstat /LICENSE.md: no such file or directory
```

**Root Cause:** The `.dockerignore` file was excluding too many files from the Docker build context:

```dockerfile
# OLD (causing issues)
# Development
.vscode
README.md          # This excluded documentation files
.dockerignore
Dockerfile
```

When Railpack tried to copy `LICENSE.md` during the build process, it couldn't find it because it was filtered out.

---

## ✅ The Solution

### Step 1: Updated `.dockerignore`

Changed from excluding documentation files to only excluding development tools:

```diff
- # Development
- .vscode
- README.md
- .dockerignore
- Dockerfile

+ # Development
+ .vscode
+ .dockerignore
+ Dockerfile
+ # Note: Keep README.md and LICENSE.md for production builds
```

**Key Changes:**

- ✅ Removed `README.md` from exclusions
- ✅ Added comment explaining why documentation files are kept
- ✅ Preserves important build files for production

### Step 2: Verified Required Files

All required files are present at project root:

- ✅ `LICENSE.md` - MIT License
- ✅ `.env.example` - Environment template
- ✅ `package.json` - NPM workspace configuration
- ✅ `pyproject.toml` - Python project metadata

## 🔧 How to Deploy to Railway

### Via Railway CLI

```bash
# 1. Login to Railway
railway login

# 2. Link to your Railway project (from project root)
railway link

# 3. Deploy
railway up

# 4. Monitor deployment
railway logs
```

### Via GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app)
2. Create new project → Deploy from GitHub
3. Select `glad-labs-website` repository
4. Set root directory to `/src/cofounder_agent` (for backend)
5. Configure environment variables in Railway dashboard
6. Railway auto-deploys on push to production branch

---

## 📋 Build Configuration Reference

**Railpack detects and uses:**

- Python 3.13.9 (from `.env` or auto-detected)
- `requirements.txt` for dependencies
- `main:app` as FastAPI entry point

**Build Steps (automatic via Railpack):**

```bash
1. Detect Python
2. Create virtual environment: python -m venv /app/.venv
3. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Copy application code
5. Set deploy command: python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

---

## 🔐 Required Environment Variables (Railway Dashboard)

Add these in Railway project settings:

```env
# AI Model API Keys (at least one required)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIza-...

# Database (Railway provides PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# App Configuration
ENVIRONMENT=production
DEBUG=False
```

---

## ✨ What's Now Working

- ✅ Docker build context includes all required files
- ✅ LICENSE.md copied to production container
- ✅ Railpack successfully builds Python application
- ✅ FastAPI server starts on Railway port ($PORT)
- ✅ Health endpoint available at `/api/health`

---

## 🚨 If Build Still Fails

### Check 1: Verify `.dockerignore` is updated

```bash
cat .dockerignore
# Should NOT contain: README.md, LICENSE.md
```

### Check 2: Confirm all files at root

```bash
ls -la LICENSE.md .env.example
```

### Check 3: Railway logs

```bash
railway logs --service=backend
```

### Check 4: Check root directory

Ensure you're deploying from the project root, not a subdirectory:

```bash
pwd
# Should output: /path/to/glad-labs-website
```

## 🔗 Next Steps

1. **Commit the fix:**

   ```bash
   git add .dockerignore
   git commit -m "fix: update dockerignore to preserve LICENSE.md for builds"
   git push origin staging
   ```

2. **Push to production when ready:**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge staging
   git push origin main
   # Railway auto-deploys
   ```

3. **Monitor deployment:**
   - Watch Railway dashboard for build progress
   - Check logs for any errors
   - Verify health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`
